# Fire Emblem: Three Houses Gardening Tool


This program assumes that you can plant up to 5 seeds and that you have unlocked all the cultivate methods. I may in the future have another prompt for professor level and all that stuff, but as of right now, that has not happened.

You must type in what you want to grow exactly. This includes capitalization, hyphens, and spaces (and correct spelling of course).

Don't worry about what "TOPS" and "BOTTOMS" mean. 

Each seed combination has a star rating. More stars mean a higher likelihood to get the item.

This program produces all viable seed combinations using AT MOST 2 different types of seeds. Honestly, full support for up to 5 different seeds would likely make the program run far too slowly.


This program uses only the standard python library and the math library.
